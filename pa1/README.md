List.h
- The helper file that allows both the List.c and Lex.c files to function properly

List.c
- An ADT, that contains a list of Nodes that contain an int data type as well as the pointers to the file before and after it. This file also contains a series of functions to modify and change the list ADT. My computer has been giving me an error where the index function has already been built in and interfering with the index function in this file. I have ignored it and it has not been an issue but I am still unclear about why this is happening.

ListTest.c
- A file that test the functionality of the List ADT so that each function works as proper. It creates a new List ADT and makes it run different functions and testing if the output is the same as the expected. It the outputs are the same then it is passing but it there are any differences then it has failed. 

Lex.c
- A C file that takes in an input text file, arranges it by alphabetical order than puts that information into an output text file.
